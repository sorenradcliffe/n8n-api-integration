## Stages

1. Parse the source into scenes or jobs.
2. Write a structured plan with stable IDs.
3. Validate prompt, duration, ratio, and references.
4. Submit jobs and persist request IDs.
5. Poll and download artifacts into a run directory.
6. Assemble, caption, and publish only after a human review.

See [`workflow/plan.yaml`](./workflow/plan.yaml) and [`docs/runbook.md`](./docs/runbook.md).
